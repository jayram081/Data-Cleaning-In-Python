# Data Cleaning In Python
Cleaning and preparing data in Python for Analysis

- Will effectively diagnose and treat missing data in **Python**.
- In this notebook, we will :
  - Import data into **`pandas`**, and use simple functions to diagnose problems in our data.
  - Visualize **missing** and **out of range** data using **`missingno`** and **`seaborn`**.
  - **Apply a range of data cleaning tasks** that will ensure the delivery of accurate insights.
  - Make sure we have a clean dataset ready for data analysis.
